Read Me- Macoma balthica survival

This file contains the average Macoma balthica survival at each site sampled during the field survey in 2004.  Survival is calculated as the average density in the fall sampling divided by the average sampling in the spring at each site. River represents the river the sample was taken in, Site represents the site name, Date represents the date the sample was taken.   The average DO represents the average dissolved oxygen concentration (mg O2/L) during the summer months observed at each site during that year.  Site locations and raw DO measurements are available in the Sites and physical measurements files, and the raw densities are available in the Macoma balthica densities file.
